## League of Legends: Analyzing Pro Side Selection
League of Legends: Analyzing Pro Side Selection is a data science project done at UCSD that goes through the complete data science process - from question formulation and data cleaning to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and predictive modeling. We look starting side - blue and red - and how this can influence gameplay, match statistics, and outcomes.

### Introduction
#### Background
**League of Legends** is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) developed by Riot games where two teams of 5 fight to destroy each other's base, or "Nexus." It is a widely known game and there are many professional leagues that compete in this esport, leading to the creation of the data set that we will be working with from Oracle's Elixer. We will specifically be looking at the 2025 data set, which can be found [here](https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads)
