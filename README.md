## League of Legends: Analyzing Pro Side Selection
League of Legends: Analyzing Pro Side Selection is a data science project done at UCSD that goes through the complete data science process - from question formulation and data cleaning to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and predictive modeling. We look at starting side - blue and red - and how this can influence gameplay, match statistics, and outcomes.

### Introduction
**League of Legends** is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) developed by Riot games where two teams of 5 fight to destroy each other's base, or "Nexus." It is a widely known game and there are many professional leagues that compete in this esport, leading to the creation of the data set that we will be working with from Oracle's Elixer. We will specifically be looking at the 2025 data set, which can be found [here](https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads)

The primary question we are looking at: **Is there a statistically significant blue side advantage for pro League of Legends player in 2025, and what factors contribute to this?**
Side selection may seem like a small detail, but at the highest level, these finer details such as improved camera perspective, first pick selection, and easier access to objectives can have massive impacts on pro play. This project seeks to truly understand if there is any statistically significant advantage to blue side. 
The data and statistics here will segway into our predictive model in which we will predict if an Attack Damage Carry (ADC) has the in-game statistics to "carry" his team to victory.
These questions highlight the metrics that truly go into success in a LoL game and has the potential to improve team-strategy and offer up a better understanding of fairness and balance in the game.
